Unofficial implementation of Neural Architecture Search for Effective Teacher-Student Knowledge
Transfer in Language Models ([Trivedi et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09639)).

I could not find any implementation of it so I implemented it while trying to stay as close as possible with the original paper.
